Your Connection Is Not Private
==============================

Overview
--------

The browser warning **"Your connection is not private"** typically indicates issues with a websiteâ€™s SSL/TLS certificate. It means the browser cannot confirm the identity of the website, which can compromise user security.

Common Causes
-------------

- **Expired or invalid SSL certificates**
- **Mismatched domain names**
- **Untrusted certificate authorities**
- **Self-signed certificates (common in development)**

Security Implications
---------------------

This message protects users from potential **man-in-the-middle attacks**, where malicious actors could intercept sensitive data.

Best Practices
--------------

- Always use **valid HTTPS certificates** from trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs)
- Ensure proper **certificate renewal and domain matching**
- Avoid transmitting sensitive data over insecure connections

In development, you may bypass the warning, but for production, securing your site is essential for **trust, safety, and compliance**.
